# *Prio* - The Intelligent Task Management App

Prio to-do app is designed to help you make the most of spare moments. Using Prio, you can quickly log things you need to get round to, prioritise and sort them, then mark them complete.

Prio currently uses HTML5, CSS3, a little Bootstrap 5.3 and Javascript.

This project represents my first foray into JS scripting and DOM manipulation.

## Use
Prio is designed to be used to quickly record tasks that you need to remember. It has the ability to record tasks in Low, Medium and High categories, allowing the user to quickly see what they most urgently need to tackle.

## Future scope
I intend to continue this project through to a full-stack application as I progress as a developer. Future desired features include:

- Proper storage of Task properties and the ability to edit existing tasks
- Greater task detail such as dates, attachments, categories etc
- Dynamic task sorting high to low
- Locally cached tasks and lists 
- Centrally stored tasks and lists
- Automatic AI categorisation

The full version will use:
HTMX + Express, Swapy.js, Prisma ORM, BetterAuth, Tailwind
